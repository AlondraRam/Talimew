<h1>My Name</h1>
<p>I use Talimew and Kilala mew as nicknames online. When I was about 12 I was introduced to video games and anime and so of course this was my life at the time, and I guess you could say still is. Talim is a from Soul Calibur 2, one of the fighting games that can be found in old arcades, and Kilala is from InuYasha, a demon cat that I found adorable. I have no idea where mew came from but I've kept it since then. In person though, some people never use the 'A' in Alondra. I end up hearing "Londra" and some people ended up taking that and calling me "laundry".</p>

<h1>Short Biography</h1>
<p>As a kid I was very awkward and very shy, but I didn't care so much about little things. The only difference now is that I am still awkward but I wouldn't say shy, and that I care way too much about even the smallest things.</p>
