<h1>My Name</h1>
<p>I use Talimew and Kilala mew as nicknames online. When I was about 12 I was introduced to video games and anime and so of course this was my life at the time, and I guess you could say still is. Talim is a from Soul Calibur 2, one of the fighting games that can be found in old arcades, and Kilala is from InuYasha, a demon cat that I found adorable. I have no idea where mew came from but I've kept it since then. In person though, some people never use the 'A' in Alondra. I end up hearing "Londra" and some people ended up taking that and calling me "laundry".</p>

<h1>Memorable Facts</h1>
<p>Sometimes it's hard to remember people by their faces or names or by what they did, but funny or weird things always seem to stay stuck in the memories.</p>
<div>
<p>For starters, one of my only physical fears is roller skating. Yes there's heights and really fast rides and maybe clowns but they cant top the amount of fear I get when I have a pair of skates on. The story behind this one is that I had broken my arm my first time skating. I was 6 years old and never again did I ride anything that involved wheels and balance until I was 13 (I eventually trusted a bike). For some reason I'm still scared to death about it.</p>
<div>
<p>As a kid I was scared of the sound the VCR made when it would rewind the movie cassetes.</p>

<h1>Interests</h1>
<p>I love to play video games, listen to certain types of music, read, stationary aesthetics, as well as things that are very out of the ordinary wether it be funny or dark. I like to think, and things that make me think differentlu make me feel as though I've stepped into another dimension sometimes #woke. </p>
